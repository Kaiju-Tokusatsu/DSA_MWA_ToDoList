Hi Daniel,

For this submitted version of the app I have built it on PhoneGap Build with the Hydration feature turned OFF.

I did this because of intermittent problems with this feature, it worked some of the time but other times
it caused the app to hang necessitating a shutdown & restart often multiple times.

Details of my GitHub repo are included in the attached file 'phonegap.jpg'

QR Code for the app is in the attached file 'qr code.png'

I've also included the .apk file for completeness.


Regards,
Tom.
